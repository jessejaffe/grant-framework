### Overview

- **Name:** AI Ambassador Programs for Business to Business Sales Leads
- **Brief Description:** LeadSparker has assembled a large team of ambassadors in the gig economy, equipped with AI tools. These ambassadors take a pre-defined lead list and engage with target social media accounts, creating a human touchpoint that is scalable. This process is coordinated by the LeadSparker core team, ensuring consistent engagement.
- **Relationship to EOS Network / Antelope:** LeadSparker is meant to create leads for EOS EVM projects
- **Reason for Interest:** As long time EOS holders and community members, the LeadSparker core team believes the EOS EVM is where business development capital should be allocated in order to most effectively grow the EOS ecosystem. 

### Project Details

- An overview of the technology stack to be used
- Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture, etc. to be deployed:

   - [LeadSparker process flow2](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12GAGl1uGlVcMYqs91rPXskwFRUolfPyt/view)
   - [LeadSparker process flow3](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OdRMt68cT15_m_2v4QzOsnjwB3vsHjjf/view)
- What your project is _not_ or will _not_ provide or implement
  - LeadSparker does not make sales / close deals. 

### Ecosystem Fit

- Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?
   - LeadSparker acts as a filter to find projects interested in deploying on the EOS EVM. It allows the ENF to more efficiently allocate business and research development resources.   
- Who is your target audience (chain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?
   - Any project listed on Coingecko, and is active on Twitter. 
- What need(s) does your project meet?
   - The need to find and incentivize more popular dApps on EOS. 
- Are there any other projects similar to yours in the EOS Network / Antelope ecosystem?
  - The most similar is Effect.ai because they also employ a large network for micro-tasking purposes. From my discussions with them, the differences lie in how their workforce is organized (more decentralized than bees) and the type of microtasks they incentivize (more towards AI labeling).

### Team Experience

> Please describe the team's relevant experience. If your project involves development work, we would appreciate it if you singled out a few interesting projects or contributions made by team members in the past. For research-related grants, references to past publications and projects in a related domain are helpful. If you applied for a Pomelo grant in the past, please be sure you listed them in the section above and mention them in detail in this section.

The LeadSparker team is approaching 2 years experience in managing a microtask workforce. The EOS community is familiar with our Swarm service, detailed in this Pomelo grant --> https://pomelo.io/grants/eosbees

A Swarm represents open-source Web3 technology and a large network of real humans who are incentivized to engage on social media content on Twitter. The value comes from the Bees engaging simultaneously. It creates amplified effects on the social media algorithms. It creates positive sentiment for EOS, as measured by social sentiment tools.

## Development Status

LeadSparker is currently operational. We have deployed a campaign to promote LeadSparker and Swarms, proving we can effectively surpass both qualification steps (leads responding) and organize a team across multiple offerings. 

The [LeadSparker case study](https://leadsparker.medium.com/leadsparker-case-study-112ce14c5bea) highlights the 2-step lead qualification process via real world examples. 

This proposal is to implement the LeadSparker process on 950-1000 leads that fit the criteria of:
1. Being active on Twitter - has tweeted at least once in the last 2 weeks
2. Having a profile on coingeico with at least $1MM and maximum of $380MM marketcap.

We project that 50% of the leads will pass criteria #1. This means 2000 leads will need to be considered for inclusion in building the lead list. 

## Development Roadmap

This section should break the development roadmap down into milestones and deliverables. To assist you in defining it, we have created a document with examples for some grant categories [here](../docs/grant_guidelines_per_category.md). Since these will be part of the agreement, it helps to describe _the functionality we should expect in as much detail as possible_, plus how we can verify and test that functionality. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to this document to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions, it should be clear how your project is related to the EOS ecosystem. We _recommend_ that teams structure their roadmap as 1 milestone ≈ 1 month.

For each milestone,

- make sure to include a specification of your software. _Treat it as a contract_; the level of detail must be enough to later verify that the software meets the specification.
- include the amount of funding requested _per milestone_.
- include documentation (tutorials, API specifications, architecture diagrams, whatever is appropriate) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
- provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to set up and run them.
- commit to providing Dockerfiles for the delivery of your project.
- indicate milestone duration as well as number of full-time employees working on each milestone.
- **Deliverables 0a-0c are mandatory for all milestones**, and deliverable 0e at least for the last one. If you do not intend to deliver one of these, please state a reason in its specification (e.g. Milestone X is research oriented and as such there is no code to test).

> :zap: If any of your deliverables is based on someone else's work, make sure you work and publish _under the terms of the license_ of the respective project and that you **highlight this fact in your milestone documentation** and in the source code if applicable! **Teams that submit others' work without attributing it will be immediately terminated.**

### Milestone Summary

> You **must** keep these three Milestone Summary lines below for your grant to be approved.  The Total Cost should add up to the costs
> of all of your Milestones.  Please **DO NOT** remove the three lines below.  If you do, your grant will be rejected or delayed while you fix it.
- **Total Estimated Duration:** 2 months 
- **Full-Time Equivalent (FTE):** 2 FTE
- **Total Costs:** 12,000 USD

> Please remember to delete all lines that start with `>` as they are just instructions and not needed in the application submission.<br/>
> 
> Notes on above fields:
> - Total Estimated Duration: Duration of the whole project (example: 2 months or 7 weeks)
> - Full-Time Equivalent (FTE): This is the average number of full-time employees working on the project throughout its duration (see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-time_equivalent), example: 2 FTE or possibly 2.5 FTE as it is an average)
> - Total Costs: This should be the requested amount in USD for the whole project (example 12,000 USD). Note that the acceptance criteria and additional benefits vary depending on the [level](../README.md#grant-levels) of funding requested. This and the costs for each milestone need to be provided in USD; if the grant is paid out in EOS, the amount will be calculated according to the exchange rate at the time of payment.
